### üëã Hi, I'm Arunn. 

I'm a full-time data scientist, and a part time writer.

As a data scientist, I design, develop, and deploy large-scale machine learning solutions to help businesses make better data-driven decisions.

As a writer, I share my personal experiences from building a data science career, hands-on technical tutorials, and building profitable side-hustles.

When I'm not working, I'm travelling (I still fear heights), playing badminton, reading, or sipping coffee at a local cafe.
