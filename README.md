# 👋 Hi, I'm Arunn. 👨‍💻 📊
<img src="https://github.com/arunnthevapalan/arunnthevapalan/blob/main/github_banner.png">

I'm a full-time data scientist and a part-time writer.

As a data scientist, I design, develop, and deploy large-scale machine-learning solutions to help businesses make better data-driven decisions.

As a writer, I share my personal experiences from building a data science career, hands-on technical tutorials, and building profitable side hustles.

When I'm not working, I'm travelling (I still fear heights), playing badminton, reading, or sipping coffee at a local cafe.
